        <h1>Testimony by Joyce <!-- Reid --></h1>
        <p>I have been applying the oil and things have improved immensely, to God be the glory.
            Looking forward to finding some contract work now I am fit and well, I can walk, the other day I did a 'quick step; to catch the bus - wow. I never thought I would be able to do that again - God is good, I am back, looking to doing some TA work, as I can now bend my knees. Life is still full of challenges, as it always is, but God is good and with his grace all good things are able.</p>

        <h1>Testimony by Angela <!-- Wynter --></h1>
        <p>My Aunt had been suffering for a number of months with a chronic headache which was causing her to not be able to get on with her daily life. This illness was very debilitating and was causing her not to be able to tend to her ailing husband. I could see that there had not been any improvement over months so I asked my fellow Christians Gloria and Eze to come and pray for her in the house.
            I provided what I thought was the correct address and went to the house waiting for their arrival.
            I arrived at my uncle’s house to find I had given the wrong door number (as I know the house by sight). I had no phone on me but the Holy Spirit told me to leave a note at the address which I had given.
            When Gloria and Eze arrived after a long journey with many obstacles, they saw the note and by the grace of God they found the house.
            We began to sing hymns and worship the Lord and the Holy Spirit came down on us very strong and touched everyone in the room. I personally received a very great sense of the love of the Lord.
            Eze anointed Aunty Bessie and prayed over her and spoke the word of the Lord over her.
            By the time we were due to leave she already appeared brighter and over the following weeks she has gone from strength to strength by the Grace of God.</p>

        <h1>Testimony by Survived Covid19 Church member</h1>
        <p>A member of our local assembly here in Lagos (a lady) got exposed at her work place to someone who came in from UK with Covid-19 and she caught the virus. She tested positive along-side her colleague and the original carrier who flew in from abroad and they were all taken to one of the isolation centers here in Lagos. Thanks to God she is now healed and discharged earlier this week.This was her experience during her stay at the Isolation Centre. Definitely, it will be useful to us and the world at large.1. She said while at home, she had no serious symptoms except for mild fever, a blocked nostril and joint aches. She treated it with malaria medicine and was fine. But NCDC had to come for them because the man from UK who was the main carrier was having serious symptoms and after the test, their results also came out positive and so they had to be kept at the isolation center.2. At the isolation center: The next day after they were taken in, the doctors came and she was given (a) Vitamin C, (b) Chloroquine, (c) Augmentin, and (d) Antiretroviral drugs. She said she took this medication only once because she reacted to it (she was stooling heavily). So after the first medication, she didn’t take any medication again.3. What She took that cured her: She got one of the medical personnel to help her buy (a) Ginger, (b) Garlic, (c) Honey, and (d) Lemon. She quizzed them together with little water and was drinking the juice. They took her sample again after two days and when the result came out, she was negative. She continued with the therapy and her second negative result came out after the second test was conducted and she was afterwards discharged after proper check and counselling.• When she was there, some of those she met there who have been taking the drugs the doctors provide saw her progress and enquired to know what she was taking. She opened up to the few she had bonded with for fear of the official. Those she told even started chewing the garlic and ginger and to her surprise, two who were seriously down were discharged even before her. She said that the officials know that ginger, garlic, honey and lemon can cure this virus but out of fear they won’t open up to Nigerians because government is making money from this whole thing.The doctors told them that Covid-19, when contacted, the immune system naturally fights it. The virus has only a life span of 14days in the body and within that period, it moves about in people’s body without any harm or symptom until it finds an underlying medical condition which it preys on. In most cases, it is the symptoms of this medical condition that increases and end up killing the patient. Majority of those who die are those who have existing medical conditions which the virus preys on.Her advice: The doctors told them to ensure their immune system is boosted, treat any existing medical condition and everything will be fine. She also added that people should on their own take ginger, garlic, lemon and honey, once in a while to clear the system and don’t wait until they are knocked down.
            Thank you everyone, I know it’s a long read, but I feel I had to share. Please pass this to all and sundry, you could be saving lives. God bless you.</p>
