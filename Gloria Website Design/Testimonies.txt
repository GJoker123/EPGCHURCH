Testimonties:

I  have been applying the oil and  things have improved immensely, to God be the glory.
Looking forward to finding some contract work now I am fit and well, I can walk, the other day I did a 'quick step; to catch the bus - wow. I never thought I would be able to do that again - God is good, I am back, looking to doing some TA work, as I can now bend my kneesEmoji Life is still full of challenges, as it always is, but God is good and with his grace all good things are able'.

My Aunt had been suffering for a number of months with a chronic headache which was causing her to not be able to get on with her daily life. This illness was very debilitating and was causing her not to be able to tend to her ailing husband. I could see that there had not been any improvement over months so I asked my fellow Christians Gloria and Eze to come and pray for her in the house.
I provided what I thought was the correct address and went to the house waiting for their arrival.
I arrived at my uncleâ€™s house to find I had given the wrong door number (as I know the house by sight). I had no phone on me but the Holy Spirit told me to leave a note at the address which I had given.
When Gloria and Eze arrived after a long journey with many obstacles, they saw the note and by the grace of God they found the house.
We began to sing hymns and worship the Lord and the Holy Spirit came down on us very strong and touched everyone in the room. I personally received a very great sense of the love of the Lord.
Eze anointed Aunty Bessie and prayed over her and spoke the word of the Lord over her.
By the time we were due to leave she already appeared brighter and over the following weeks she has gone from strength to strength by the Grace of God.
